# WhereAreYou

Locate other mobile phones just be sending a text message (SMS). 

#Description
Have you ever been wondering where your spouse is? Missing your children? Your phone calls are not answered? Then install "Where Are You?".

This app allows you to send a simple text message (SMS) with a magic keyword to your friend's mobile and his/her mobile will directly respond with the latest location. Simple, easy and ensures privacy as both have to install the app and agree on a common keyword.

This app makes use of Google Maps and the Google Geolocation API to identify a cell phone tower and therefore even works without GPS activated.

#Issues
Google changed its policy about apps in the Google Play Market using SMS permissions. Therefore this app has been denied to be published via the official Play market.
